I was wondering if getting a new refrigerator would be possible? The one I have now is missing pieces and some pieces inside the refer are broken. Also, would painting the whole unit be possible? The restroom cabinets look like they could be replaced they haven’t been in great shape since I moved in. The blinds from the smaller room don’t open or close I’m not sure if the stick to turn them is broken but we’ve never been able to open them. Lastly could my room and bathroom doors be replaced. The paint has chipped from a couple of them making them look brown in some spots. Thank you ",New,19,"Mendoza, Mary",03/01/2025,,Infinity Gardens Apartments LLC

I’m not sure where they are coming from but our apartment is not dirty or filthy to where we should be having so many little bugs the way I seen. It seems they are coming from behind the stove and the refrigerator because that’s where they went when I sprayed and also I seen one coming up from behind the stove when I sprayed. There are gaps in our kitchen from when we first moved in so not sure if those need to be closed or what but need it to be inspected asap. ,,New,I204,"Mendez, Justin A.",02/18/2025,,"Infinity Reserve at Waters, LLC"

I sent a maint. request on 1/12/25, on 2 issues that have never been completed for at least 2 years. I got the text on 2/11 to everyone saying to be patient with maint. requests as you are short staffed. My (2) maint. requests (sub multiple times in 2yrs) was submitted 3 months ago. Please have someone come fix the #1 issue, the pipe in the bathroom, behind the tub, from 1st to 3rd floor .The pipes shake and are loud, which recreated the cracks in the wall that were never finished the first time and the ceiling above the tub never fully fixed. the 2nd issue, more cosmetic but over 2yrs &amp; not completed. It is very embarrassing to have people over, and look like you live in the ""ghetto"". Also, I was told on 1/21/2025 by Lenny in text that if I renew I would get an upgrade, which hasn't been offered since I renewed my lease for 4/1.

I have consistently provided proof of my valid vehicle registration to the apartment office. In previous instances, the towing company has returned my car without charge at the apartment's request. Unfortunately, this issue persists despite my prior communications with both your office and the contracted towing company.  In my absence, my sister, unaware of the recurring nature of this problem, paid the $200 towing fee to retrieve my vehicle.

I hope you’re well. I’m writing to request maintenance support for a few issues in my unit. The stove and dishwasher are no longer functioning properly and may need to be replaced. Additionally, the bathroom currently does not have an exhaust fan, which is causing excess moisture buildup.

I would greatly appreciate it if these items could be addressed as soon as possible:
	1.	Replace the stove
	2.	Replace the dishwasher soap dispenser 
	3.	Install an exhaust fan in the bathroom

Please let me know the next steps and an estimated timeline for these repairs. I’m available for maintenance access at your convenience.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

I sent an email to the guy who was in charge before with the fotos I believe his name was Omar and no one ever did anything. The only thing they did was come &amp; repaint the master bathtub. In my opinion that seems to be the fix to everything here just paint over things that need much more than that. We are paying a fair amount in rent.

I attached photos in the past request. Now in that same bathroom there is electrical problems with the light. This whole thing is rusted out. Please pay more attention to the inside of the units rather than be worrying about the outside like painting &amp; pressure washing. Some of These units are old &amp; need to be kept up with maintenance. I also mentioned our washer does not properly work it doesn’t sound like a normal washer should. It sounds too forced.

It’s been a while since I am asking for you to replace the shower faucet without any response from you.
Based on contract I have to report any leaks in my unit to avoid damages to the property. But, even if I’ve been reporting a leak In my bathroom it seems that nobody cares about it.

I understand you have things to do, but, will University pay for the electricity wasted because of the leak of hot water? I had to pay $215.00 because the leak lasted for almost a month. Will I have to eat another month for this leak to be fixed. As tenant I have the responsibility of pay on time, but, as landlord you have the responsibility to fix any leak in my unit.
